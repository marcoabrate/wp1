# Demos

In this folder we provide numerous "example scripts" or "demos" which will help when learning `RatInABox`. In approximate order of complexity, these include:

* [simple_example.ipynb](./simple_example.ipynb): a very simple tutorial for importing RiaB, initilising an Environment, Agent and some PlaceCells, running a brief simulation and outputting some data.
* [extensive_example.ipynb](./extensive_example.ipynb): a more involved tutorial. More complex enivornment, more complex cell types and more complex plots are used. 
* [list_of_plotting_functions.md](./list_of_plotting_fuctions.md): All the types of plots available for are listed and explained. 
* [readme_figures.ipynb](./readme_figures.ipynb): (Almost) all plots/animations shown in the root readme are produced from this script (plus some minor formatting done afterwards in powerpoint).
* [paper_figures.ipynb](./paper_figures.ipynb): (Almost) all plots/animations shown in the paper are produced from this script (plus some major formatting done afterwards in powerpoint).
* [decoding_position_example.ipynb](./decoding_position_example.ipynb): Postion is decoded from neural data generated with RatInABox using linear regression. Place cells, grid cell and boundary vector cells are compared. 
* [reinforcement_learning_example.ipynb](./reinforcement_learning_example.ipynb): RatInABox is use to construct, train and visualise a small two-layer network capable of model free reinforcement learning in order to find a reward hidden behind a wall. 
* [path_integration_example.ipynb](./path_integration_example.ipynb): RatInABox is use to construct, train and visualise a large multi-layer network capable of learning a "ring attractor" capable of path integrating a position estimate using only velocity inputs.
